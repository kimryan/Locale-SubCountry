    NOTE: On September 2, 2008, FIPS 10-4 was one of ten standards withdrawn by NIST as a
    Federal Information Processing Standard. FIPS data will remain in this module for now.

    Clean up pre-reqs in Makefile.PL
    Add Build.PL.
    Add encoding to POD in Locale::SubCountry

1.51 2 July 2012
    Many new countries added, thanks to Ron Savage
    Sub countries added to existing countries
    Many corrections to sub country data

    Converted tests to use Test::Simple in main.t
    Added test for regional_division
    Added test for initialising with 2 letter country code
    Improved synopsis

    Fixed typo in 'new' method that was stopping the use of 2 letter country codes
    being used as a parameter. Note, this also caused a faliure in the tests for
    the dependant module, Lingua::EN::AddressParse


1.46 6 Apr 2011
    Fixed main.t so tests now use title cased country names.
    Corrected typos in Changes, README, SubCountry.pm demo.pl, thanks to Glenn Fowler

    Added data for Montenegro as a separate country
    Added data for Serbia as a separate country
    Added Hong Kong and it's districts (it also appears as a region of China)
    Corrections to documentation

    Country names are now stored in title case, not all capitals, as in Fiji and not FIJI.
    This was done to improve readability (original ISO date used upper case)
    NOTE, this means that when calling the new method with a country name, you need
    to specify the name in title case. It will not work if you use upper case. This
    could cause some backward compatibility issues from your calling code.

1.44 20 Jan 2011

1.21 9 Sep 2002
    Fixed bug in test script main.t

1.20 7 Sep 2002

    Added methods to new Locale::SubCountry::World package
    - new
    - all_full_names
    - all_codes
    - full_name_code_hash
    - code_full_name_hash

    NOTE!
    all_full_names method replaces the stand alone all_country_names function
    all_codes method replaces the stand alone all_country_codes function
    The above method names duplicate existing method names (polymorphism),
        so make sure you are working with the right type of object first.

    These changes were necessary because of user requests for country name
    and code look ups prior to sub-country lookups. Previous versions would not
    work with Locale::Country because of a clash in exported names. Thanks to
    Todd Green for this suggestion.

    Added the FIPS 10-4 (US standard) for many sub countries
    Added FIPS10_4_code method
