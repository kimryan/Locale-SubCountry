DESCRIPTION

This module allows you to convert the full name for a countries administrative
region to the code commonly used for postal addressing. The reverse lookup
can also be done.

Sub countries are termed as states in the US and Australia, provinces
in Canada and counties in the UK and Ireland. Other terms include region,
department, city and territory.

Names and ISO 3166-2 codes for all sub countries in a country can be
returned as either a hash or an array.

Names and ISO 3166-1 codes for all countries in the world can be
returned as either a hash or an array. This in turn can be used to
fetch every sub country from every country (see examples/demo.pl).

Sub country codes are defined in "ISO 3166-2,
Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions".

ISO 3166-2 codes can be converted to FIPS 10-4 codes. The reverse lookup can
also be done. Note that FIPS 10-4 has been deprecated.
